The Development of an advanced Language Learning Model (LLM) program using Python. While Python lacks a native drag-and-drop GUI, we utilized TKinter Designer and Figma to create a vibrant and user-friendly interface. The program features an intelligent login system, with a unique functionality that emails login details to users through its integrated Gmail account. User account information is securely stored in a SQLite database, ensuring data integrity and security.

The core of the LLM model focuses on translating words between English, Afrikaans, and IsiZulu, catering to multilingual needs. Additionally, the program includes a sophisticated text-to-speech feature, enhancing accessibility and providing a more inclusive user experience. This combination of functionalities makes our LLM program a robust and versatile tool for language translation and learning.
